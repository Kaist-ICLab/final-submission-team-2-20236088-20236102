# How to run our project

## Datacollection
Open the sketch in `sketches/data_collection`, compile and run it on the arduino. Pipe the output into a logfile that you then convert into a .csv.

## Preprocess
You need python (tested with 3.10 and 3.11) and the pandas library. Run by 

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

## Model Training
Upload the `IoT_Project.ipynb` file to google colab and run all. Upload the files `output.npy` and `input.npy` from the data folder (generated by preprocess). In the last cell you can find the binaries for the trained model. Copy the binaries and paste it into `model.cpp` in `sketches/knocking_translator`. You should also copy the scalers `mean_` and `scale_` values `intosketches/knocking_translator/knocking_translator.imo` for correct scaling. 

## Model Deployment
Go into `sketches/knocking_translator` and open `knocking_translator.imo` in Arduino IDE. Build the model and upload it to the Arduino. Enjoy.
